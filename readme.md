# imap shell

## Simple remote shell with public imap servers.

This under develepment project is suspended due to only a few public imap servers both support IDLE and full functional SEARCH.
Gmail does, but unfortunately blocked by GFW.

Another project aiming to support multiple data exchange background is on working.
